    Hello! I'm Andria, a current junior from the Bay Area. I'm very excited to be teaching Data 188 this semester! Previously, I taught Data C88C. I also do research in reinforcement learning! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing board games, and trying random new things. Looking forward to getting to know you all! :D
