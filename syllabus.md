IMPORTANT(2026-01-09) This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and not finalized.


## Technology


### Edstem

We will use **Edstem** as the primary means of communication for the course.
This includes: Q&A forum, and official announcements.

**Enrollment in Ed is mandatory.
It is your responsibility to regularly check Ed for important announcements.**
**Failure to do so may result in severe consequences for your ability to succeed in this course.**

**To join the class Ed**: after you have officially enrolled in the course and are added to the bCourses, you will be automatically added to the course Ed.
If you are not able to access the Ed, please email the course instructors.

If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Ed rather than emailing the instructor or TAs.

**Regarding posting solutions/code**: Please do not post anything
resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you
should make your post private (visible to instructors only).

**Tip**: the best (and fastest!) way to get help is to ask a question on Edstem.
You are welcome to ask questions about nearly anything, including: assignments, course concepts, tangentially-related topics, applications to academia/industry, etc.

Finally: feel free to ask interesting questions, or answer questions yourself!
We hope to foster a positive community where students can help each other out.
Course staff also enjoys pondering and answering interesting questions.

### Gradescope

All homework will be submitted through **Gradescope**, and all grades will be
returned through Gradescope.

**To join the class Gradescope**: after you have officially enrolled in the course and are added to the bCourses, you will be automatically added to the course Gradescope.
If you are not able to access the Gradescope, please email the course instructors, or create a private question on Edstem.

### bCourses

Lecture videos will be available from the **bCourses site**, under the "Media Gallery" section.
We will not use bCourses for any other content.

## Participation and Attendance

Attendance for lectures/discussions will not be tracked, nor part of your grade.
With that said, we encourage you to attend as much of the course in-person as possible (including attending the Zoom lectures "live"), as we believe consistent active engagement leads to positive outcomes in terms of learning and course grades.

**Participation extra credit**: Students that are particularly active in a noteworthy, productive manner in the course (eg Edstem, lecture, discussion) will be granted extra credit points at the end of the semster.
This will be done at the instructor's discretion.

## Exams

There will be one midterm, and a final exam.
Both exams will be on campus, in-person, paper and pencil, and proctored by course staff.
Electronic devices are not allowed, including: calculators, smart phones, laptops.

For the midterm, you are allowed one page (double sided) of notes.
For the final exam, you are allowed two pages (double sided) of notes.

Exams will cover all material covered in: lectures, discussion section, and assignments.


| Name | Date | Time (PST) | Location |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Midterm | Tuesday March 10th 2026 | 7:00 PM - ? | [Genetics and Plant Biology 0100](https://rtl.berkeley.edu/classroom-database/genetics-and-plant-biology-0100) |
| Midterm (DSP) | Tuesday March 10th 2026 | 7:00 PM - ? | [Anthropology & Art Practice 115](https://dac.berkeley.edu/navigating-berkeley/classrooms/115-anthropology-art-practice) |
| Alternate Midterm | Wednesday March 11th 2026 | 7:00 PM - ? | [Genetics and Plant Biology 0100](https://rtl.berkeley.edu/classroom-database/genetics-and-plant-biology-0100) |
| Alternate Midterm (DSP) | Wednesday March 11th 2026 | 7:00 PM - ? | [Anthropology & Art Practice 115](https://dac.berkeley.edu/navigating-berkeley/classrooms/115-anthropology-art-practice) |
| Final | Thursday May 14th 2026 | 11:30 AM - ? | ? |

Note: exam durations are not yet finalized, but will not exceed 3 hours.

**Alternate Midterm Exam Policy**: We will grant alternate midterm exam times only for extenuating circumstances, and must be approved by the instructor.
This alternate midterm exam time is defined in the above table, as "Alternate Midterm".
If you require taking the midterm exam at this alternate exam time, please contact the course staff ASAP (ideally at least one week before the midterm exam), eg by creating a private Ed post.
There will be no other alternate midterm exam times.

**Excused Midterm**: If, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to take the midterm exam (eg circumstances outside of your control prevent you from taking the midterm at either the primary or the alternate time), then your midterm score will be replaced by the final exam score.
Ex: if the grading breakdown was 40% HW, 20% Midterm, 40% Final, then your new grading breakdown would be 40% HW, 60% Final.
You must get explicit approval from course staff for this **BEFORE** the exam.

**Alternate Final Exam Policy**: As of 2026-01-16, while I would like to offer an "Alternate Final" in case there are final exam conflicts, I have not yet received department confirmation that this is possible. Stay tuned for details. In the meantime, if you know that you are unable to make the current Final Exam date+time, please contact course staff ASAP so that we can figure something out. All students must take the final exam to pass the course: there will be no "Excused Final Exam" policy.

**DSP Exams Accommodations**: We will accommodate those with exam-related DSP accommodations.
Course staff will reach out to DSP students regarding scheduling DSP exams: if you have DSP exam accommodations and have not been reached out within a week of the exam, please contact course staff by making a private Ed post.


## Materials

### Discussion Sections

The intent for discussion section is to go over course concepts in greater detail than covered in lecture, while having the benefit of small group learning headed by your discussion TA.
This is a valuable opportunity to learn not only from your TA's, but also from your peers.

You may attend whichever, as many, and as few discussion sections you like.
Attendance is not tracked, nor part of your grade.

### Homeworks

There will be several homework assignments for this class.
You will submit your assignments on Gradescope.
Grades will be released on Gradescope.

Doing the homeworks is vital for your learning. You are expected to show your work and
justify all of your answers.

Homework and projects will be graded by correctness, typically via Gradescope autograder. There will be unlimited autograder attempts allowed.

**Late policy**: late submissions will not be accepted.

Tip: the Gradescope autograder will award partial credit based on partial progress.
Even if you don't completely finish an assignment, you should at least submit what you have to avoid getting 0 points.

**Extenuating circumstances**: we understand that unexpected things can come up that can interfere with your coursework.
If you feel strongly that circumstances outside of your control are preventing you from submitting coursework on time, please contact course staff ASAP to request an extension.
If it involves sensitive data, feel free to directly email the instructor.
Otherwise, create a private Ed post and we will assist you from there.

### Lectures

The intent for lectures is to "steer" the course by introducing course concepts, drilling down into important concepts, and more broadly supporting student learning.

Lecture slides (pdfs) and recordings will be published to the students for later viewing.

Lecture attendance is not tracked nor part of your grade.

**Online (Zoom) Lectures**: lectures will be done on Zoom, via "live streaming".

## Disabled Students' Program (DSP)

This course will honor student accommodations granted by the [Disabled Students' Program (DSP)](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/home).

Note that, if you do have DSP accommodations, please ensure that your accomodations letter is submitted to the DSP office before the start of the semester (or, at least early in the semester) to ensure that you will receive your DSP accommodations.
We will only honor DSP accommodations that have an official letter backed by the DSP office.

## Academic Integrity


### Cheating

Ethical behavior is an important part of being an engineer. It is a part of our
responsibility to act ethically and honestly, and moreover, ethical behavior is
what helps you learn best. Cheating is fundamentally dishonest and antisocial
behavior. We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating.
Any unconfessed offense
will result in negative consequences, along with a referral to the Center for Student Conduct.

You are not permitted to upload any of our problems, solutions, or your own
solutions to our problems to any site that is accessible by other people. Use
Ed to discuss content. The only limited exceptions to this are online
communication mediums between you and the collaborating individuals explicitly
listed on your homework assignment. Looking at online solutions from previous
semesters or other students is forbidden, as is sharing of your solutions with
others. Furthermore, students all have an affirmative duty to report possible
cases of cheating or unauthorized communication to the course staff,
immediately. Acknowledgement of and failure to report cheating implicates the
bystander since this is academic misconduct. Cheating hurts us all and
engineering ethics requires us to point out wrongdoing when we are aware of it.

### Collaboration

You are encouraged to collaborate on homeworks with others; however, this
collaboration must be limited to high-level discussion. **All coding must be done
on your own**, and you should not discuss specific solutions or look at another’s
code.

Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework
problems, but you must always credit all such sources and you must never copy
material verbatim. You must explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked
with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework.

### AI policy

In 2026, AI in the classroom (especially "Generative AI") takes on many forms, including: coding assistants, personalized tutors, highly effective search engines, etc.

In this course: we permit the usage of AI for purposes of **learning and understanding**, including:
- Asking an LLM to explain a course concept
- Asking an LLM to explain why a particular coding implementation works
- etc.

In this course, we do not permit the usage of AI for **generating anything you turn in**, including:
- Asking an AI to directly generate code to use in your assignments
- Asking an AI to answer a homework/exam question
- etc.

A good litmus test is: if you were being tutored by a course staff member (say, a TA), would you be comfortable asking the TA to do what you'd ask the AI to do?

<!-- While, in practice, there's no way for me to stop students from utilizing AI for less-than-ethical reasons, I leave you with this thought: there is incredible value in facing, struggling with, and overcoming challenging material. -->
<!-- The growth that you undergo through such challenges grant you abilities (problem solving skills, grit, determination) that will make you valuable wherever you choose to go after university. -->

Any violations of the "AI policy" will be treated as an Academic Integrity violation, with appropriate consequences.

**Regarding coding assistants**: although I understand the temptation to utilize coding assistants for coursework, I do feel strongly that one should first develop a strong foundation in Python/numpy/pytorch coding abilities before relying on coding assistants.

## Grading

(2026-01-11: grade breakdown not yet finalized)

The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Homework: 40%
- Midterm Exam: 20%
- Final Exam: 40%

Attendance will not be graded or tracked for lectures/discussions.

Final course grades will be subject to a curve to meet university and departmental guidelines.
Note that this may result in a curve either upwards or downwards, depending on how things go.

Extra credit: during the semester there may be opportunity for extra credit.
For instance, class participation, etc.

**Incompletes**: I highly recommend students to NOT rely on Incomplete grades being granted for this course.
As this course is not a regularly offered course (as opposed to, say, Data C88C), it's highly unlikely that we will grant any Incomplete grades for this course.
